### ![MercuryInfo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcchiken505/Mercury-Project/refs/heads/main/img/mercuryinfo.png) What is this? 

Mercury Project - Experimental project whose goal is to port Outfit7 mobile games/apps based on the Talking Tom franchise.

#### Mercury Project is 100% safe.
If your Antivirus blocks the file with the launcher, then do not be misled. Unfortunately, we do not have a digital signature for applications, so the launcher with ports will be found by the antivirus as a virus, but this is not so!

#### Our ports are optimized.
Our ports are optimized and do not eat up much RAM, so your system will not lag while the port is open!

#### 100% accurate recreations.
We care about how our ports look and try to make them as close to the original as possible. 

## Completed ports and their accuracy:

### 2010:
|Game/App name|Percentage of completion|

|Talking Tom|100%|

## ![Info](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcchiken505/Mercury-Project/refs/heads/main/img/info.png) FAQ
### Are the ports official?

No, Not official. Ports are fan-made, as is the Outfit7 Rewritten team. All rights to characters, games, layout of this site belong to Outfit7. We do not receive any profit from the Mercury Project.

### What versions are the ports based on?

on IOS and Android versions. Most of the ports are based on the IOS versions, but also on the Android versions.

### Will there be ports of new Outfit7 games?

No, they won't. Some of Outfit7's games are made in 3D, but unfortunately we don't have 3D skills, older games are easier to make because they are already divided into frames.
