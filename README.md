## Are the ports official?

No, Not official. Ports are fan-made, as is the Outfit7 Rewritten team. All rights to characters, games, layout of this site belong to Outfit7. We do not receive any profit from the Mercury Project.

## What versions are the ports based on?

on IOS and Android versions. Most of the ports are based on the IOS versions, but also on the Android versions.

## Will there be ports of new Outfit7 games?

No, they won't. Some of Outfit7's games are made in 3D, but unfortunately we don't have 3D skills, older games are easier to make because they are already divided into frames.

## What about new 2D Games from Outfit7?

They won't be there either. We just don't see the point. We don't think that new games have given anyone their childhood.
